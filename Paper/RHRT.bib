	abstract = {SummaryBackground
Identification of high-risk patients after acute myocardial infarction is essential for successful prophylactic therapy. The predictive accuracy of currently used risk predictors is modest even when several factors are combined. Thus, establishment of a new powerful method for risk prediction independent of the available stratifiers is of considerable practical value.
Methods
The study investigated fluctuations of sinus-rhythm cycle length after a single ventricular premature beat recorded in Holter electrocardiograms, and characterised the fluctuations (termed heart-rate turbulence) by two numerical parameters, termed turbulence onset and slope. The method was developed on a population of 100 patients with coronary heart disease and blindly applied to the population of the Multicentre Post-Infarction Program (MPIP; 577 survivors of acute infarction, 75 deaths during a median follow-up of 22 months) and to the placebo population of the European Myocardial Amiodarone Trial (EMIAT; 614 survivors of acute myocardial infarction, 87 deaths during median follow-up of 21 months). Multivariate risk stratification was done with the new parameters and conventional risk factors.
Findings
One of the new parameters (turbulence slope) was the most powerful stratifier of follow-up mortality in EMIAT and the second most powerful stratifier in MPIP:MPIP risk ratio 3·5 (95\% Cl 2·2–5·5, p\&lt; 0·0001), EMIAT risk ratio 2·7 (1·8–4·2, p\&lt; 0·0001), In the multivariate analysis, low left-ventricular ejection fraction and turbulence slope were the only independent variables for mortality prediction in MPIP (p\&lt; 0·001), whereas in EMIAT, five variables were independent mortality predictors: abnormal turbulence onset, abnormal turbulence slope, history of previous infarction, low left-ventricular ejection fraction, and high mean heart rate (p\&lt; 0·001). In both MPIP and EMIAT, the combination of abnormal onset and slope was the most powerful multivariate risk stratifier: MPIP risk ratio 3·2 (1·7–6·0, p\&lt; 0·0001), EMIAT risk ratio 3·2 (1·8–5·6, p\&lt; 0·0001).
Interpretation
The absence of the heart rate turbulence after ventricular premature beats is a very potent postinfarction risk stratifier that is independent of other known risk factors and which is stronger than other presently available risk predictors.},

	abstract = {Heart period constantly changes on a beat to beat basis, due to autonomic influences on the sinoatrial node, and changes can be quantified as heart rate variability (HRV). In addition, after a premature ventricular beat, there are reproducible variations in RR interval, also due to baroreflex mediated autonomic influences on the sinoatrial node, that can be measured as heart rate turbulence (HRT). Impaired autonomic function as measured by HRV and HRT has proven to predict adverse outcomes in clinical settings. The ability of reduced HRV and HRT to predict adverse outcomes has been explained by their dependency on vagal mechanisms that could reflect an increased sympathetic and a reduced vagal modulation of sinus node, thus favoring cardiac electrical instability. Analysis of non-linear dynamics of HRV has also been utilized to describe the fractal like characteristic of the variability signal and proven effective in identify patients at risk for sudden cardiac death. Despite the clinical validity of these measures, it has also been evident that the relationship between neural input and sinus node responsiveness is extremely complex and variable in different clinical conditions. Thus, abnormal HRV or HRT on a clinical Holter recordings may reflect non-neural as well as autonomic mechanisms, and this also needs to be taken into account when interpreting any findings. However, under controlled conditions, the computation of the low and high frequency components of HRV and of their normalized powers or ratio seems capable of providing valid information on sympatho-vagal balance in normal subjects, as well as in most patients with a preserved left ventricular function. Thus, analysis of HRV does provide a unique tool to specifically assess autonomic control mechanisms in association with various perturbations. In conclusion, HRV measures are of substantial utility to identify patients with an increased cardiac mortality and to evaluate autonomic control mechanisms, but their ability to capture specific levels of autonomic control may be limited to controlled laboratory studies in relatively healthy subjects.},

	abstract = {This consensus statement has been compiled on behalf of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrophysiology. It reviews the topic of heart rate turbulence (HRT) and concentrates on technologies for measurement, physiologic background and interpretation, and clinical use of HRT. It also lists suggestions for future research. The phenomenon of HRT refers to sinus rhythm cycle-length perturbations after isolated premature ventricular complexes. The physiologic pattern of HRT consists of brief heart rate acceleration (quantified by the so-called turbulence onset) followed by more gradual heart rate deceleration (quantified by the so-called turbulence slope) before the rate returns to a pre-ectopic level. Available physiologic investigations confirm that the initial heart rate acceleration is triggered by transient vagal inhibition in response to the missed baroreflex afferent input caused by hemodynamically inefficient ventricular contraction. A sympathetically mediated overshoot of arterial pressure is responsible for the subsequent heart rate deceleration through vagal recruitment. Hence, the HRT pattern is blunted in patients with reduced baroreflex. The HRT pattern is influenced by a number of factors, provocations, treatments, and pathologies reviewed in this consensus. As HRT measurement provides an indirect assessment of baroreflex, it is useful in those clinical situations that benefit from baroreflex evaluation. The HRT evaluation has thus been found appropriate in risk stratification after acute myocardial infarction, risk prediction, and monitoring of disease progression in heart failure, as well as in several other pathologies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart rate turbulence (HRT) has recently been described as a strong, independent risk stratifier in postinfarct patients. To date, however, the incidence of false positive HRT findings in adults is unknown. Therefore, we performed a blinded, retrospective analysis of HRT in a prospectively collected database of 110 apparently healthy persons to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of abnormal HRT findings in healthy controls using previously published cut-off values.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 43 out of 110 apparently healthy adults, in whom a sufficient number of ventricular premature beats were available for HRT analysis on 24-hour Holter recordings. The HRT slope was dichotomized at 2.5 ms per R-R interval and HRT onset was dichotomized at 0\% using previously established criteria to define an abnormal HRT analysis in postinfarct patients. Using these definitions, abnormal HRT results were found in 2 out of 43 controls (5\%) for HRT slope and in 8 out of 43 controls (19\%) for HRT onset without any cardiac deaths during 32 +/- 15 months follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of false positive HRT results in healthy middle-aged volunteers is low for HRT slope (5\%), but not for HRT onset (19\%) when previously published cut-off values are used to define abnormal HRT results. Thus, HRT slope dichotomized at 2.5 ms per R-R interval, but not HRT onset dichotomized at 0\%, may be used as a relatively specific tool for risk stratification in middle-aged persons.},

	abstract = {Heart rate turbulence (HRT) is a biphasic reaction to a ventricular premature contraction (VPC) mainly mediated by the baroreflex. It can be used for risk stratification in different disease patterns. Despite existing standards there is a lot of variation in terms of measuring and calculating HRT, which complicates research and application. Objective: This systematic review outlines and evaluates the methodological spectrum of HRT research, especially filtering criteria, parameter calculation and thresholds. Approach: The analysis includes all research papers written in English that have been published before 12.10.2018, are listed on PubMed and involve calculation of HRT parameter values. Main results: HRT assessment is still being performed in various ways and important specifications of the methodology are not given in many articles. Nevertheless, some suggestions regarding HRT methodology can be made: a normalised turbulence slope should be used to uncouple the parameter from heart rate and frequency of extrasystoles. Filtering criteria as formerly reviewed in the guidelines should be met and mentioned. The minimal number of VPC snippets (VPCSs) as well as new cut-off values for different risks need to be further evaluated. Most importantly, the exact and complete methodology must be described to ensure reproducibility and comparability. Significance: Methodical variation hinders comparability of research and medical application. Our continuing questions help to further standardise the measurement and calculation of HRT and increase its value for medical risk stratification.},
