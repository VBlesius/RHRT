	abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Identification of high-risk patients after acute myocardial infarction is essential for successful prophylactic therapy. The predictive accuracy of currently used risk predictors is modest even when several factors are combined. Thus, establishment of a new powerful method for risk prediction independent of the available stratifiers is of considerable practical value.
Methods
The study investigated fluctuations of sinus-rhythm cycle length after a single ventricular premature beat recorded in Holter electrocardiograms, and characterised the fluctuations (termed heart-rate turbulence) by two numerical parameters, termed turbulence onset and slope. The method was developed on a population of 100 patients with coronary heart disease and blindly applied to the population of the Multicentre Post-Infarction Program ({MPIP}; 577 survivors of acute infarction, 75 deaths during a median follow-up of 22 months) and to the placebo population of the European Myocardial Amiodarone Trial ({EMIAT}; 614 survivors of acute myocardial infarction, 87 deaths during median follow-up of 21 months). Multivariate risk stratification was done with the new parameters and conventional risk factors.
Findings
One of the new parameters (turbulence slope) was the most powerful stratifier of follow-up mortality in {EMIAT} and the second most powerful stratifier in {MPIP}:{MPIP} risk ratio 3·5 (95\% Cl 2·2–5·5, p\&lt; 0·0001), {EMIAT} risk ratio 2·7 (1·8–4·2, p\&lt; 0·0001), In the multivariate analysis, low left-ventricular ejection fraction and turbulence slope were the only independent variables for mortality prediction in {MPIP} (p\&lt; 0·001), whereas in {EMIAT}, five variables were independent mortality predictors: abnormal turbulence onset, abnormal turbulence slope, history of previous infarction, low left-ventricular ejection fraction, and high mean heart rate (p\&lt; 0·001). In both {MPIP} and {EMIAT}, the combination of abnormal onset and slope was the most powerful multivariate risk stratifier: {MPIP} risk ratio 3·2 (1·7–6·0, p\&lt; 0·0001), {EMIAT} risk ratio 3·2 (1·8–5·6, p\&lt; 0·0001).
Interpretation
The absence of the heart rate turbulence after ventricular premature beats is a very potent postinfarction risk stratifier that is independent of other known risk factors and which is stronger than other presently available risk predictors.},

	abstract = {Heart period constantly changes on a beat to beat basis, due to autonomic influences on the sinoatrial node, and changes can be quantified as heart rate variability ({HRV}). In addition, after a premature ventricular beat, there are reproducible variations in {RR} interval, also due to baroreflex mediated autonomic influences on the sinoatrial node, that can be measured as heart rate turbulence ({HRT}). Impaired autonomic function as measured by {HRV} and {HRT} has proven to predict adverse outcomes in clinical settings. The ability of reduced {HRV} and {HRT} to predict adverse outcomes has been explained by their dependency on vagal mechanisms that could reflect an increased sympathetic and a reduced vagal modulation of sinus node, thus favoring cardiac electrical instability. Analysis of non-linear dynamics of {HRV} has also been utilized to describe the fractal like characteristic of the variability signal and proven effective in identify patients at risk for sudden cardiac death. Despite the clinical validity of these measures, it has also been evident that the relationship between neural input and sinus node responsiveness is extremely complex and variable in different clinical conditions. Thus, abnormal {HRV} or {HRT} on a clinical Holter recordings may reflect non-neural as well as autonomic mechanisms, and this also needs to be taken into account when interpreting any findings. However, under controlled conditions, the computation of the low and high frequency components of {HRV} and of their normalized powers or ratio seems capable of providing valid information on sympatho-vagal balance in normal subjects, as well as in most patients with a preserved left ventricular function. Thus, analysis of {HRV} does provide a unique tool to specifically assess autonomic control mechanisms in association with various perturbations. In conclusion, {HRV} measures are of substantial utility to identify patients with an increased cardiac mortality and to evaluate autonomic control mechanisms, but their ability to capture specific levels of autonomic control may be limited to controlled laboratory studies in relatively healthy subjects.},

	abstract = {This consensus statement has been compiled on behalf of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrophysiology. It reviews the topic of heart rate turbulence ({HRT}) and concentrates on technologies for measurement, physiologic background and interpretation, and clinical use of {HRT}. It also lists suggestions for future research. The phenomenon of {HRT} refers to sinus rhythm cycle-length perturbations after isolated premature ventricular complexes. The physiologic pattern of {HRT} consists of brief heart rate acceleration (quantified by the so-called turbulence onset) followed by more gradual heart rate deceleration (quantified by the so-called turbulence slope) before the rate returns to a pre-ectopic level. Available physiologic investigations confirm that the initial heart rate acceleration is triggered by transient vagal inhibition in response to the missed baroreflex afferent input caused by hemodynamically inefficient ventricular contraction. A sympathetically mediated overshoot of arterial pressure is responsible for the subsequent heart rate deceleration through vagal recruitment. Hence, the {HRT} pattern is blunted in patients with reduced baroreflex. The {HRT} pattern is influenced by a number of factors, provocations, treatments, and pathologies reviewed in this consensus. As {HRT} measurement provides an indirect assessment of baroreflex, it is useful in those clinical situations that benefit from baroreflex evaluation. The {HRT} evaluation has thus been found appropriate in risk stratification after acute myocardial infarction, risk prediction, and monitoring of disease progression in heart failure, as well as in several other pathologies.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Heart rate turbulence ({HRT}) has recently been described as a strong, independent risk stratifier in postinfarct patients. To date, however, the incidence of false positive {HRT} findings in adults is unknown. Therefore, we performed a blinded, retrospective analysis of {HRT} in a prospectively collected database of 110 apparently healthy persons to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of abnormal {HRT} findings in healthy controls using previously published cut-off values.
{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: The study included 43 out of 110 apparently healthy adults, in whom a sufficient number of ventricular premature beats were available for {HRT} analysis on 24-hour Holter recordings. The {HRT} slope was dichotomized at 2.5 ms per R-R interval and {HRT} onset was dichotomized at 0\% using previously established criteria to define an abnormal {HRT} analysis in postinfarct patients. Using these definitions, abnormal {HRT} results were found in 2 out of 43 controls (5\%) for {HRT} slope and in 8 out of 43 controls (19\%) for {HRT} onset without any cardiac deaths during 32 +/- 15 months follow-up.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The incidence of false positive {HRT} results in healthy middle-aged volunteers is low for {HRT} slope (5\%), but not for {HRT} onset (19\%) when previously published cut-off values are used to define abnormal {HRT} results. Thus, {HRT} slope dichotomized at 2.5 ms per R-R interval, but not {HRT} onset dichotomized at 0\%, may be used as a relatively specific tool for risk stratification in middle-aged persons.},

	abstract = {Heart rate turbulence ({HRT}) is a biphasic reaction to a ventricular premature contraction ({VPC}) mainly mediated by the baroreflex. It can be used for risk stratification in different disease patterns. Despite existing standards there is a lot of variation in terms of measuring and calculating {HRT}, which complicates research and application. Objective: This systematic review outlines and evaluates the methodological spectrum of {HRT} research, especially filtering criteria, parameter calculation and thresholds. Approach: The analysis includes all research papers written in English that have been published before 12.10.2018, are listed on {PubMed} and involve calculation of {HRT} parameter values. Main results: {HRT} assessment is still being performed in various ways and important specifications of the methodology are not given in many articles. Nevertheless, some suggestions regarding {HRT} methodology can be made: a normalised turbulence slope should be used to uncouple the parameter from heart rate and frequency of extrasystoles. Filtering criteria as formerly reviewed in the guidelines should be met and mentioned. The minimal number of {VPC} snippets ({VPCSs}) as well as new cut-off values for different risks need to be further evaluated. Most importantly, the exact and complete methodology must be described to ensure reproducibility and comparability. Significance: Methodical variation hinders comparability of research and medical application. Our continuing questions help to further standardise the measurement and calculation of {HRT} and increase its value for medical risk stratification.},

This paper presents a software package for quantitative evaluation of heart rate variability ({HRV}), heart rate turbulence ({HRT}), and T-wave alternans ({TWA}) from {ECG} recordings. The software has been developed for the purpose of scientific research rather than clinical diagnosis.

Material/Methods
The software is written in Matlab Mathematical Language. Procedures for evaluation of {HRV}, {HRT} and {TWA} were implemented. {HRV} analysis was carried out by applying statistical and spectral parametric and nonparametric methods. {HRT} parameters were derived using the Schmidt algorithm. {TWA} analysis was performed both in spectral and in time domain by applying Poincare mapping. A flexibility of choosing from a number of classical modelling approaches and their modifications was foreseen and implemented. The software underwent preliminary verification tests both on {ECGs} from the Physionet online {ECG} signal repository and recordings taken at the Department of Electrocardiology of the Medical University Hospital in Lodz.

Results
The result of the research is a program enabling simultaneous analysis of a number of parameters computed from {ECG} recordings with the use of the indicated analysis methods. The program offers options to preview the intermediate results and to alter the preprocessing steps.

Conclusions
By offering the possibility to cross-validate the results of analyses obtained by several methods and to preview the intermediate analysis steps, the program can serve as a helpful aid for clinicians in comprehensive research studies. The software tool can also be utilized in training programs for students and medical personnel.},

Many calculation methods have been developed to address these issues, each with their strengths and weaknesses. Although, its interpretation may remain difficult, this technique provides, from a non-invasive approach, reliable physiological information that was previously inaccessible, in many fields including death and health prediction, training and overtraining, cardiac and respiratory rehabilitation, sleep-disordered breathing, large cohort follow-ups, children's autonomic status, anesthesia, or neurophysiological studies. In this context, we developed {HRVanalysis}, a software to analyse {HRV}, used and improved for over 20 years and, thus, designed to meet laboratory requirements. The main strength of {HRVanalysis} is its wide application scope. In addition to standard analysis over short and long periods of {RR} intervals, the software allows time-frequency analysis using wavelet transform as well as analysis of autonomic nervous system status on surrounding scored events and on preselected labeled areas. Moreover, the interface is designed for easy study of large cohorts, including batch mode signal processing to avoid running repetitive operations. Results are displayed as figures or saved in {TXT} files directly employable in statistical softwares. Recordings can arise from {RR} or {EKG} files of different types such as cardiofrequencemeters, holters {EKG}, polygraphs, and data acquisition systems. {HRVanalysis} can be downloaded freely from the Web page at: https://anslabtools.univ-st-etienne.{frHRVanalysis} is meticulously maintained and developed for in-house laboratory use.
