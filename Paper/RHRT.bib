	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Identification of high-risk patients after acute myocardial infarction is essential for successful prophylactic therapy. The predictive accuracy of currently used risk predictors is modest even when several factors are combined. Thus, establishment of a new powerful method for risk prediction independent of the available stratifiers is of considerable practical value.
{METHODS}: The study investigated fluctuations of sinus-rhythm cycle length after a single ventricular premature beat recorded in Holter electrocardiograms, and characterised the fluctuations (termed heart-rate turbulence) by two numerical parameters, termed turbulence onset and slope. The method was developed on a population of 100 patients with coronary heart disease and blindly applied to the population of the Multicentre Post-Infarction Program ({MPIP}; 577 survivors of acute infarction, 75 deaths during a median follow-up of 22 months) and to the placebo population of the European Myocardial Amiodarone Trial ({EMIAT}; 614 survivors of acute myocardial infarction, 87 deaths during median follow-up of 21 months). Multivariate risk stratification was done with the new parameters and conventional risk factors.
{FINDINGS}: One of the new parameters (turbulence slope) was the most powerful stratifier of follow-up mortality in {EMIAT} and the second most powerful stratifier in {MPIP}: {MPIP} risk ratio 3.5 (95\% {CI} 2.2-5.5, p{\textless}0.0001), {EMIAT} risk ratio 2.7 (1.8-4.2, p{\textless}0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, low left-ventricular ejection fraction and turbulence slope were the only independent variables for mortality prediction in {MPIP} (p{\textless}0.001), whereas in {EMIAT}, five variables were independent mortality predictors: abnormal turbulence onset, abnormal turbulence slope, history of previous infarction, low left-ventricular ejection fraction, and high mean heart rate (p{\textless}0.001). In both {MPIP} and {EMIAT}, the combination of abnormal onset and slope was the most powerful multivariate risk stratifier: {MPIP} risk ratio 3.2 (1.7-6.0, p{\textless}0.0001), {EMIAT} risk ratio 3.2 (1.8-5.6, p{\textless}0.0001).
{INTERPRETATION}: The absence of the heart rate turbulence after ventricular premature beats is a very potent postinfarction risk stratifier that is independent of other known risk factors and which is stronger than other presently available risk predictors.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Heart rate turbulence ({HRT}) has recently been described as a strong, independent risk stratifier in postinfarct patients. To date, however, the incidence of false positive {HRT} findings in adults is unknown. Therefore, we performed a blinded, retrospective analysis of {HRT} in a prospectively collected database of 110 apparently healthy persons to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of abnormal {HRT} findings in healthy controls using previously published cut-off values.
{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: The study included 43 out of 110 apparently healthy adults, in whom a sufficient number of ventricular premature beats were available for {HRT} analysis on 24-hour Holter recordings. The {HRT} slope was dichotomized at 2.5 ms per R-R interval and {HRT} onset was dichotomized at 0\% using previously established criteria to define an abnormal {HRT} analysis in postinfarct patients. Using these definitions, abnormal {HRT} results were found in 2 out of 43 controls (5\%) for {HRT} slope and in 8 out of 43 controls (19\%) for {HRT} onset without any cardiac deaths during 32 +/- 15 months follow-up.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The incidence of false positive {HRT} results in healthy middle-aged volunteers is low for {HRT} slope (5\%), but not for {HRT} onset (19\%) when previously published cut-off values are used to define abnormal {HRT} results. Thus, {HRT} slope dichotomized at 2.5 ms per R-R interval, but not {HRT} onset dichotomized at 0\%, may be used as a relatively specific tool for risk stratification in middle-aged persons.},

	abstract = {Heart rate turbulence ({HRT}) is a biphasic reaction to a ventricular premature contraction ({VPC}) mainly mediated by the baroreflex. It can be used for risk stratification in different disease patterns. Despite existing standards there is a lot of variation in terms of measuring and calculating {HRT}, which complicates research and application. Objective: This systematic review outlines and evaluates the methodological spectrum of {HRT} research, especially filtering criteria, parameter calculation and thresholds. Approach: The analysis includes all research papers written in English that have been published before 12.10.2018, are listed on {PubMed} and involve calculation of {HRT} parameter values. Main results: {HRT} assessment is still being performed in various ways and important specifications of the methodology are not given in many articles. Nevertheless, some suggestions regarding {HRT} methodology can be made: a normalised turbulence slope should be used to uncouple the parameter from heart rate and frequency of extrasystoles. Filtering criteria as formerly reviewed in the guidelines should be met and mentioned. The minimal number of {VPC} snippets ({VPCSs}) as well as new cut-off values for different risks need to be further evaluated. Most importantly, the exact and complete methodology must be described to ensure reproducibility and comparability. Significance: Methodical variation hinders comparability of research and medical application. Our continuing questions help to further standardise the measurement and calculation of {HRT} and increase its value for medical risk stratification.},
